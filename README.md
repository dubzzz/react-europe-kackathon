# react-europe-kackathon

## Why?

I just wanted to play play with Kendo UI and some GraphQL API using Apollo in the context of the Hackathon of React Europe 2020.
This project is far from production ready. It was just for fun.

## Run it

1. The app requires to create a personal access token on GitHub without any specific rights
https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line

2. Run it locally with `yarn && yarn start`

3. Paste the token

4. Update the repository if you want to see another one - _please note that stars are retrived 100 by 100 so big repositories can be very long to analyze_
